Folder Contents:
_archive: contains old code and saved images
	- spiral_array_classifier.ipynb: contains original KNN and SVM implementations
	- image_conversion.py: also has KNN (revist at some point)
code_files: contrains all the python files with organized functions (originally written in spiral_image_classifier_rev2.ipynb
	- these cannot go through debugging because VScode does not seem to like debug mode on API (keras and tensorflow)
	- reorganized all tensorflow related functions into a JupyterNotebook (spiralClassifier_rev3.ipynb), 
	  but still pull other functions as needed

Jupyter Notebooks: 
 - spiral_image_classifier_rev2: contains all original code from Summer 2022 
 - objectDetection: locates the centers of the spirals (later to be used in unraveling the spiral)
